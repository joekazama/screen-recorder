# screen-recorder
# this is a screen recorder, although it's not perfect.  
# fps set to match real time should be at 10.0   In other words it records three times faster, or has 2/3 less frames.  Maybe it'll be different on other devices.
# HAS ADJUSTABLE CROP.  
  # can tell it to record any customizable part of the screen.  
  # however must be a square dimension.  Dont know why the opencv write function has such problems with non square
  # the resolution variable must match the dimensions the cropped variable is feeding in.  
  # comment out cropped for full screen.
